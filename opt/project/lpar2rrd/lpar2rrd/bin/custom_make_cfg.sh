#
# LPAR2RRD custom group configuration file
#
# It is a configuration file for creating custom groups of lpars
# they are shown separately in the gui and aggregated
# typical usage is for clusters or for lpars running one application
#
# Usage
# below you see simple lpar list. If you want to create a group called "cluster_one"
# then simply after the double coma of lpars you wish place that name
# When a lpar needs to belong to more groups then create a new row with a new group name
# As soon as it is done then you will see the new group under "Custom" page on the web
#
# If you need to use double colon in lpar/pool/group name then prefix it by backslash
# Rows without group name are ignored
#
# You can use wild cards in server name and pool/lpar name
# Examples
#  POOL:.*:.*:pool-all   --> group pool-all will contain all pools from all servers
#  LPAR:.*:.*:lpar-all   --> group lpar-all will contain all lpars from all servers
#  LPAR:p[6,7].*:vio.*:vio-p67  --> group vio-p67 will contain lpars started vio* from servers started with p6 or p7 string
#
#

# [POOL|LPAR]:server:[lpar_name|pool_name]:your_group_name
