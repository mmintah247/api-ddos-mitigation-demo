# HMC rename script
# it goes through LPAR2RRD data dir, and renames old HMC data for new HMC name
# Note: It deletes all data belonging to the new HMC (it moves then to $backup_dir)
#
# from LPAR2RRD working dir (/home/lpar2rrd/lpar2rrd) run this:
# 1. Assure you have a backup of data directory
# 2. comment out crontab entries
#   - load.sh
#   - load_hmc_rest_api.sh
# 3. run this cmd for HMC rename
#  ./bin/hmc_rename.sh <old HMC> <new HMC> [-c]
#  "-c" parameter says that any rename requires confirmation per server level
# 4. allow commented our crontab jobs from point 2o
# 5. force new full load and execute it
# rm tmp/[5-9]*
# ./load.sh 
# 
# You should see new HMC names in the UI

###############################
#Configure the new HMC (you might let it work in parallel if that is possible for some time)
#Gunzip the script and copy it into /home/lpar2rrd/lpar2rrd/bin (755, lpar2rrd owner)
#Make sure you have valid backup, you might create a tar ball of data dir for example.
#Assure that all data files are owned by lpar2rrd user:
#under root : chown -R lpar2rrd data
#su - lpar2rrd
#cd /home/lpar2rrd/lpar2rrd
#sh ./hmc_rename.sh <old HMC> <new HMC> -c
#
#./load.sh html
#
#Refresh the GUI
#Check the data in the GUI
#
#run the script after server migration to the new HMC.
#Does not matter when you configure the new HMC in lpar2rrd. You can do it prior running the script or after that.
#
#Remove the old HMC from etc/lpar2rrd.cfg before run the script.
